# LoungeSupplier

## What is this ?
A Simple csgolounge extension using GreaserMonkey ( FireFox )/ TamperMonkey( Chrome ).
LoungeSupplier allows you to simply spam your shitty items through lounge and notify everyone about it.
It gives you the option to AutoBump your trades and remove all your offers at once.

## How it works with Trading

1. open up your "settings", to do this simply click the big wrench that now appeared on your Menu ( on lounge )
2. Set Up everything, the description that you want to post below each trade and also wich items, to add items you have to simply add their "ID"´s in the "Enter your items here" field, to get an items id, simply click "inspect elements" when you hover over it ( for example on the "search" page. )
3. Now only enter your Username in the Last Field and click each Button.

4. Go to the "Search" Page, put in your targetted item and press search.
5. Click "Scrape Trades" and it´ll get all trades and post below them. ( you can automate this by clicking on "auto")

Basicly it should look something like this if you are offering keys ( http://i.imgur.com/5fuQ9fo.jpg )
