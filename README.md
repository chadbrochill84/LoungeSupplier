# LoungeSupplier

## What is this ?
A Simple csgolounge extension using GreaserMonkey ( FireFox )/ TamperMonkey( Chrome ).
LoungeSupplier allows you to simply spam your shitty items through lounge and notify everyone about it.
It gives you the option to AutoBump your trades and remove all your offers at once.
It also updates you whenever a new csgo match is added.

## How it works
First step would be that you settup your "settings", to do this simply click the big wrench that now appeared on your Menu ( on lounge )
